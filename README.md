# Code samples an playground for the **Rust Atomics and Locks** book

It's useful to open the crate as a doc: `cargo doc --open --document-private-items`. Although it doesn't show most of the notes as documentation => better to open sources in the docs.

It's sometimes important to install the version by the book: `rustup install 1.66.0 --profile default ; rustup target add --toolchain 1.66.0 aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`.
